# featureLabelling
Scripts and samples for labelling features, given 2D input points and camera pose.

## MAIN
* Scripts with different bolt labelling algorithms.
* Output images and text files with points from manual labelling and image processing.

## cornerImage-379
* Contains results and scripts comparing two manually labelled datasets from the same corner image.

## Source
* Original photos and input files
* Derived camera positions for original images used in MAIN and cornerImage-379



## determiningCameraPose
* Script for deriving camera parameters
* Examples of output using centre labels on image 045


## interPhotoLabelling
* Attempt at labelling adjacent images - knowing the camera position in one image and using the change in yaw to determine the camera position in the next one.
